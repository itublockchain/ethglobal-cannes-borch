*borch is the easiest way to manage group expenses using stablecoin.*

## 🧾 What is "borch."?

borch. is a group payment app that lets friends and communities manage shared expenses using stablecoins.

Whether you’re:
•⁠  ⁠Sharing the bill at dinner  
•⁠  ⁠Splitting a Netflix subscription  
•⁠  ⁠Traveling as a group  

→ borch. gives you a *shared virtual card, keeps track of **who paid what, and settles everything **instantly with USDC*.

No crypto knowledge needed.  
Just sign in with Google, get a wallet and your own ENS name, and start paying together.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🚀 Instant Onboarding with Dynamic  
We use *Dynamic* to make sign-up feel like a familiar Web2 app:

•⁠  ⁠Log in with Google — no wallet extensions, no seed phrases  
•⁠  ⁠Embedded, gasless wallets created instantly  
•⁠  ⁠Smooth *account abstraction* hides all blockchain complexity  

---

### 🆔 Your Web3 Identity, Simplified with ENS  
Every user gets a unique ENS subname (like ⁠ alice.borch.eth ⁠):

•⁠  ⁠No more copying wallet addresses  
•⁠  ⁠Use your ENS name to send/receive payments inside the app  
•⁠  ⁠Profile pictures and metadata added through *ENS text records*  

---

### 🛡️ Private Shared Cards with Oasis (Sapphire + ROFL)  
Each group gets a secure virtual card:

•⁠  ⁠Card is generated in a *TEE* using ROFL  
•⁠  ⁠Details are encrypted and stored on *Oasis Sapphire*  
•⁠  ⁠Only verified group members can access and use it  
•⁠  ⁠On-chain spending is visible, but sensitive data stays private  
•⁠  ⁠*TEE* also tracks all group spending and settlements securely  

---

### 💸 Instant USDC Settlement with Circle CCTP  
We use *Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)* for native USDC settlement:

•⁠  ⁠Native USDC across chains — no bridges, no wrapping  
•⁠  ⁠Fast, low-cost, and final transactions  
•⁠  ⁠Group members can repay from *any supported chain*

---

With *shared virtual cards, **stablecoin transfers, and **built-in privacy*,  
*borch.* makes group payments simpler, faster, and more flexible than traditional tools like Splitwise.
